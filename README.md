## Silently Failing, the blog
This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I can't guarantee I'll be in here in a year, or a month, and if you wanted to look through some of my old repositories, I'm clearly steeped in the stop-start engine sputter of project sprawl. Time to write a blog turns into what should I implement it in only plebeians use WordPress, I'm a *Real Programmer*, I should learn React but I guess I also need to learn Webpack but I'm also rubbish at CSS and apparently I need to learn Babel to transpile JS so it is compatible across browsers and what the hell is Koa or React Redux whatever and then after I copy and paste tutorial code and have a working site I grafted from someone elses creativity I need to figure out where to host this and might as well play around with load balancers and managed databases and then holy shit this would cost a billion dollars to stand up and I haven't even implemented a CMS and oh look, **anything** that isn't this, let me literally never touch this code again. The road to hell is paved with partially implemented blogs in shiny new techs.

And another thing: the world needs me. Rather, I need the world to need me. I'm sure the site traffic will dispel any notion that I have compelling things to say or could capture an online audience, but until that illusion comes crashing down and swallows me in an existential tidal wave, I have convinced myself that *just one more* blog filled with tech musings, SEO-optimized post titles, raving book reviews, and borrowed tutorials is what this troubled world needs. Because I have the answer, I have seen the light, and another résumé masquerading as a blog is it.

## TODO
[ ] Add tutorials collection
[ ] Figure out how to do book covers for the book reviews
[ ] Add in published date to entry__items
[ ] Add in book reviews to home page (in addition to posts)
