I'm not sure how I felt about this one. There are really interesting tracks of techno-dystopia that recall Gibson's Neuromancer or even Huxley's Brave New World, but that world building is gray and hazy, lost in the background of a punk rock anthem. The novel feels more punk rock than it is, the rebel yell contrasted to the inclusivity of music as music and not genre and humanity as a social organism. Corporations are positioned as the antagonizing force here, compelling people to remain cloistered in fear, but there is no real dramatic tension in the novel. The one 'betrayal' that drives tension in the later half of the novel never resolves itself, the language of whom to resist is muddled.

Further, there's something in a rebel yell to defy quarantine orders almost a year into covid-19 that rings strident; it's that rebelliousness that has needlessly prolonged a miserable shrinking of life and our ability to congregate. Certainly this argument is Pinkser's strongest, that humans need to come together, to reverse the expulsion from Babel and share in the universal language of music.
