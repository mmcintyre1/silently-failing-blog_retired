I love a good space opera. There is a whole track of science fiction whose value prop is that all humans love the drama of a good soap opera, even if they don't want to admit it. If you affix enough hi-tech gadgetry and doodads, and sprinkle on some sort of networking/cyberspace sprawl, you could call it *General Hospital* and I'm in. Good science fiction allows a certain way of telling a story, though, regardless of how far and fast we want to fling ourselves into the mutually assured destruction of a genre argument. At its best, science fiction allows for a world that exists as a toy problem, as a controlled experiment, that allows for a more concentrated inquiry into a particular facet of humanity. The plausibility for individual facets of the story matters less than if the internal logic holds. Sure, it might not be possible to implant a device into your brain stem to carry someone else's memories with you, but that's not under the microscope; the self and memory's role in forming that self are.

> So much of who we are is what we remember and retell [...]

Looking at this novel's composite pieces, it is at first a space opera, as my jacket blurb mentions in the immediate tradition of Ann Leckie and Yoon Ha Lee, but it feels natural to draw longer lines to Lois McMaster Bujold and her Vor court, and especially Cordelia's fish out of water can-doism of Bujold's *Barrayar*. The intrigue is postured as a murder investigation by Mahit, the newly-minted ambassador from the mining outpost of Lsel, who has arrived to the city shining on a hill of Teixcalaan upon the politically rife death of her predecessor, who's years delayed memory implant she wears surgically saddled to her brain stem. Martine's postdoctoral research was in Byzantine studies, and that the plot and proper nouns bear strong audience to that, and in murmuring those proper nouns while I read they certainly take trips around the mouth. I ended up shortening things to their First Letter quite often. Who has time to bumper car their way through a sesquipedalian smattering of multi-syllabic proper nouns? And while I'm on the subject of criticisms (there is so much in this book to praise that I might as well group these piddling complaints together to get them out of the way), I really hope Martine's editor stresses the need for italic moderation. All those italics are a bit more sass than I can handle.

The self, like the soul or the mind, is another casualty of modernity. Are we a continuous whole, or is the self just a *post hoc* justification of the algorithmic endocrine response, the reptile brain intermingled with what liberal humanism assures us is a higher functioning thought? The novel's dramatic tension is resolved with self unifying with other, with a *less* defunct Yksandr joining the self of Mahit, but the moral seems a bit less clear. The dialectical pattern of self and other, of T-land (I can't spell it any better than I can say it) and Lsel, of Three Seagrass and Mahit, of past and present, of empire and of memory, is writ all over the novel, and self never does neatly subsume the other.

I certainly look forward to the sequel.
