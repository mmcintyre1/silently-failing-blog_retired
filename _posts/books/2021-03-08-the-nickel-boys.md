*The Nickel Boys* is a smart novel. I hadn't read any Colson Whitehead before, but I knew going in that he was Important&trade; and that he should be read. Certainly he will find his name  The list of two-time Pulitzer winners is slim and Whitehead can count himself amongst Faulkner and Updike, and the apparently [hackish](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/11/the-rise-and-fall-of-booth-tarkington) Booth Tarkington.

I'm happy I picked it up. It's a swell book, and it works on so many levels. On the surface, its *Lord of the Flies* does *Shawshank*. The only group more disserved than children when we treat them like criminals are black children, and their story was never fully voiced when the non-fictional basis of this novel, the Dozier school, was unearthed for the Tartarus it was.

> [...] but they had been denied even the simple pleasure of being oridinary. Hobbled and handicapped before the race even began, never figuring out how to be normal.

Beyond that, this novel is a literary treat. It's built inside out, with the final framing device pivoting the entire narrative around. Without giving too much away, the final pages almost necessitate a re-read of the novel itself. Whitehead seems to be playing in a similar vein as the New Journalists did in the 50s and 60s, taking the ethos of telling fictional stories with non-fictional backdrops and pieces to say something real, and building that into the very structure of the novel. The novel is sparse and doesn't rely too much on those non-fictional grounding devices that became tired after Capote and Didion and Doctorow played them all out. There is a freshness here, a fluent brevity, where Whitehead doesn't allow language to crowd the pages.

> There was no higher system guiding Nickel's brutality, merely an indiscriminate spite, one that had nothing to do with people.

This novel, like *Fences* earlier, fingers the system itself as the villain. Earl is poisoned, and replaced by someone equally as tyrannical, and the cycle repeats. The problem is "[...] Spencer, and it was Griff, and it was all the parents who let their children wind up here. It was people".

> They waited for wayward boys in need of an attitude adjustment. They wait still, as long as the sons -- and the sons of those sons -- remember.
