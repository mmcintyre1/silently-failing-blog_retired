excerpt: We are gods with anuses.
---
> Man is literally split in two: he has an awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with a towering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order blindly and dumbly to roy and disappear forever.

Humans are divided into two irreconcilable elements, split asunder between a physical being and a symbolic self. Humans are "nothing but body as far as nature is concerned" (31), and this subjugation of the symbolic self proves the prime genesis of all neuroses, the "horror of [his] own basic animal condition" (35). The way to overcome this is to extend the symbolic self beyond the physical body through heroism, through heroic acts and a symbolic immortality. It is the reason author's write for posterity, or that adherents prostrate themselves on the altars of gods, all for a chance to extend their symbolic existence beyond the corporeal bounds of being.

> The real world is simply too terrible to admit: it tells man that he is a small, trembling animal who will decay and die. Illusion changes all this, makes man seem important, vital to the universe, immortal in some way.

Becker takes us through Kierkegaard, Otto Rank, and Freud, to paint the picture of man as a "trembling animal", building and intertwining those great thinkers and psychoanalysts who came before to weave a tale of humanity's will to heroism. As Becker is firmly of the psychoanalyst school of worldly interpretation, most of those tales can be reduced down to sex, and while this book is first about death, it is, like all books of psychoanalysis, secondarily fascinated with sex. Like Freud before, Becker finds the sexual in everything all while condemning Freud's very same tendencies.

Speaking of Freud, this book feels strongest when acting as biography of Freud. I'm sure there are novel clinical, or at least psychological thoughts, but it's a conversation I haven't immersed myself in so most of those conversations feel like they I am walking in halfway through their initiation, so I never have the full context. Freud apparently was obsessed with the idea of death and his own death, and in this I find quite a bit of solidarity.

The book is decidedly much, much weaker when dealing with mental illness, treading heavily into the problematic. Becker tells us later "how perfectly depression or melancholia is a problem of courage" (210), and several times implies that schizophrenia and other mental illnesses aren't pathological but rather a problem of orientation to the world, as if these DSM illnesses could be cured by a glass of water and someone to talk to.

All in all, this book provides a nice framework and vocabulary to give voice to the bodily shame we all feel, as we are all gods who shit. And here I was thinking that it was just growing up Catholic that did the trick.
