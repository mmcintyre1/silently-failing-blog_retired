The Propaganda Model
5 filters that act to curate what we see:

1. Size, ownership, and profit orientation
- centralized and relatively small group of entities own corporate 'main stream' media
- these companies aren't beholden to objectivity but rather to maximizing profits

2. The advertising license to do business:
- advertising has an outsized effect on the success of the news outlet
- news is actually just filler to get 'privileged' buyers to see the commercials, and the actual product is the consumer who is sold to the advertisers
- news organizations must cater to advertisers

3. Sourcing mass media news
- most news media rely heavily on corporate sourcing to generate stories, thus there is an extreme hesitancy to offend, lest they lose their sources or the scoop
- "the large bureaucracies of the powerful subsidize the mass media"

4. Flak and the enforcers
- large and well-funded corporate interests create groups to discredit the "legitimate" news that works at cross-purposes to their interests
- this is expensive to the media's bottom line

5. Anti-Communism/Fear
- began as fear-mongering against communism and might now be applied to anti-islamism or anti-terrorism
- fear and hatred of groups are exploited to rile the public opinion for or against various state interests

The government spends $1 billion every year on PR.

Chomsky and Herman then apply this Propaganda Model to various, somewhat dated, use cases, like privileged and non-privileged actors, worthy and unworthy states, legitimate and illegitimate elections.

How could we apply the Propaganda Model to
- Media reaction to Uyghurs
- Military coup in Myanmar
- Jamal Khashoggi's murder ordered by Saudi Arabia crown prince
- Fox News, and how its reliance on advertising is far overstated -- they generate much more income from lucrative and locked-in tv contracts
- The rise of the internet and the denigration of the expert
- An individual's responsibility in self-selecting content to fit their world view
