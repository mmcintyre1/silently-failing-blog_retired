### state of the race

All right. Not so hot out of the gate. I'm no mathematician (my arithmetical prowess doesn't extend much past basic numeracy), but 6 isn't going to cut it. 737,000 words isn't too bad -- it works out to about 50 hours of reading at a 250 WPM clip, but 8 books a month plus a couple 9s is the pace I need. One of the things I never got was how people read so damn quickly. One of my college professors claimed she read 800 words per minute, but what the hell kind of retention can you have driving by words in a McLaren? I've taken it far enough to do rudimentary research -- avoid sub-vocalizing words in your head some say, plug things into a speed reader device others say, use a marker still others attest, but those things either reduce comprehension to next to nothing or make the reading into some high stakes ocular calisthenics, the-sitting-on-your-couch-without-moving-for-hours-on-end version of *Man on Wire*. Reading should only occasionally be an extreme sport.

I turned 33 this month. The age of Jesus when he died. It **did not** go well for that guy. Guy was murdered, then millions of times a year for two-fucking-thousand years people eat his *literal flesh and blood* in some sadomasochistic murder cult type of ceremony while singing weird songs about how his father killed him because some lady ate an apple and women wanted to leave the kitchen. I think my goals this year are pretty modest: read 100 books, and don't get strung up to a big wooden pole until I die of exposure to the elements and suffocation. Also I'd like to get in on the bottom floor of one of those meme stocks.

### what about the books?
Anyway, this month I gave a governor's reprieve to a few bookshelf oldies (lifers on the 'to-read' shelf). Still a few more of those lifers to go, but I think I've abolished capital punishment. My birthday makes my metaphors morose, but that doesn't mean I can't be clement. I'm getting into the habit of flossing, and reading a particular year's Pulitzer, National Book Award Winners, Hugos, and Nebulas, and *A Song for A New Day* was the first of that effort. It was all right. Followed that up with a stinker in *Together: How to Stretch a Single Bullet Point into a Book*. It's probably not fair to call any book a stinker; it takes real dedication to write a book. You have to sit at your computer every day and just conjure narrative from pure dream stuff. You can't just sit behind a keyboard, post half-baked metaphors and 500 word blog posts filled with pictures and scattered self-deprecating jokes insinuating that because you are a person who can mock himself he is above reproach and pretend you are an author. What were we talking about? Oh, yeah -- Dr. Murthy is a compelling figure, but the book was just cripplingly boring. I normally read sitting up, because when I lay down I'm prone to naps, but this book might've put me to sleep standing.

Moving on. The biggest contradiction of my life is that I haven't read more Nabokov. In the the hopelessly reductive categorization of literary geeks, you have sentence people and you have story people. I'm a sentence guy. Paint a honeyed line in prose and you've got me for life; I don't care how reductive your story is or how your characters move from catch phrase to catch phrase. You would think this allegiance would assuredly fix me to Nabokov's camp, but for whatever reason, I have only read *Lolita*. I know the man can write. I have a credit card and an online shopping addiction, but I just never put it to truly good use. The man shits better English sentences than I've ever written in my entire life. *Pale Fire* is pure fire (ugh, even I hate myself). His stories move like David Lynch movies and his prose flows like Willy Wonka's chocolate river. One thing is for sure, this won't be the only Nabakov novel this year. After I put it down, I hurriedly went to Amazon (Amazon pay me money) and put his entire *ouevre* in my cart. Yee-haw.

### other odds and ends
- **auto-catalytic process** - a process that starts itself in a positive feedback loop, going faster and faster after it has started.
- Are all science fiction children raised in creches?
- Life as a hunter gatherer was pretty nice, and homo sapiens have caused nothing by mass destruction for 10,000 years.
- I'm not sure if every month I should include some inane quote from Master P's self-help book, but I'm actually reading it now and it's just not terribly funny. It's terrible, sure, but not so terrible as to be funny. It's decently well-reviewed on Amazon, and I did buy it. Meh. I shall find my guru soon enough.

### nice new words
- **encomiast**- *n.* A person who delivers or writes an encomium; a eulogist.
- **inimical**- *adj.* Injurious or harmful in effect; adverse
- **synecdoche**- *n.* A figure of speech in which the name of a part is used to stand for the whole (as hand for sailor), the whole for a part (as the law for police officer), the specific for the general (as cutthroat for assassin), the general for the specific (as thief for pickpocket), or the material for the thing made from it (as steel for sword).

### favorite quote
> But a commentator's obligations cannot be shirked, however dull the information he must collect and convey. Hence this note.
